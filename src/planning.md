Focus: Chapter Styling, Font Application, and Dark Mode Exploration

Goal: Make tangible progress on the visual refinement of chapter content and explore the implementation of a dark mode theme.

Actionable Steps:

Font Verification & Application:

Chapter Styles Refinement:

Review ChapterTemplate.svelte Styles: Examine the SCSS associated with ChapterTemplate.svelte. Ensure base layout, padding, and margins are consistent with the design goals.
Graphing Paper Theme: Revisit the graphing paper background implementation (mentioned in Memory). Check if the grid lines align reasonably well with content elements as intended. Make minor adjustments if necessary. completionMarch 29, 2025
Component Style Consistency: Review the styles of 1-2 core chapter components (e.g., Scenario, Quiz) to ensure they visually integrate well within the chapter layout and theme. Address any glaring inconsistencies. (Defer major component redesigns unless quick fixes are obvious).
Sidebar Styling (If time permits): Check if the chapter navigation sidebar (Navigation.svelte when used in chapter context) needs basic color adjustments to align with chapter themes (using lighter variable versions as noted in Memory).
Dark Mode Exploration (Initial Steps):

Next Steps (Beyond Today):

Detailed styling of individual components.
Full implementation and testing of dark mode across all components.
Adding LaTeX rendering to FormulaAccordion.
Addressing scroll handling.
