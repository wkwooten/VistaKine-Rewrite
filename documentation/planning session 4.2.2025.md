**Focus:** [User flow, visualizations, physics playground]

**Goal:** Develop a solid plan for how the user flow will work in terms of the content. Determine the role of the visualization.

**Actionable Steps:**

1.  **User flow:**
    * [ ] **Create a user flow for section 1.1
	    * [ ] Based around the 3d printer scenario
	    * [ ] Keep text short and digestible
	    * [ ] Visualization follows the scenario and continues narrative
		    * [ ] 
	* [ ] **Create physics playground:**
		* [ ] Will be testbed for features of the site
		* [ ] Create most components and ui here
		* [ ] Reverse engineer examples from threlte docs
		* [ ] Create new link
