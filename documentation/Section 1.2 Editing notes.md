Describing vectors precisely - cut down dramatically. 
- Move Equations into Equation
- Cut down text content and focus on key info
- Remove any repeated statements
- Use delta Vx instead of Vx or delta Vx = Vx = x2 - x1
- Ensure consistent color coding
  
Vector builder excerise
- Option to toggle between ijk notation and xyz notation.
- Increase camera height
	- Allow for panning for camera height?
	- Allow panning in general?
		- boundaries to prevent user getting lost
- Increase Y max to 12
	- Seems a bit cleaner and polished.
	- Possibly change dimensions to 10,10,10
