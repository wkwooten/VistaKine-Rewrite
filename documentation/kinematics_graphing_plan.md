# Kinematics Graphing Feature Plan

## Goal

Implement interactive graphs within kinematics exercises to help students visualize and understand the relationship between physical motion and its graphical representations (position, velocity, acceleration vs. time).

## Key Features

- Display interactive graphs (initially Position vs. Time and Velocity vs. Time).
- Graphs should populate with data as the user interacts with the associated simulation/exercise.
- Allow students to potentially analyze points on the graph.
- Integrate seamlessly with existing kinematics exercise components.

## Potential Target Exercises

- Existing or new 1D kinematics exercises.
- Projectile motion exercises (potentially showing components separately).

## Implementation Steps

1.  **Identify Data Sources:** Determine how to extract real-time position, velocity, and potentially acceleration data from the Threlte/Rapier simulation or exercise logic.
2.  **Choose Graphing Approach:** Research and select a suitable library or method for rendering interactive graphs in Svelte 5 (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js, or a lighter-weight custom solution using SVG).
3.  **Develop Graph Component:** Create a reusable Svelte component (`KinematicsGraph.svelte`) capable of:
    - Receiving data points over time.
    - Plotting multiple data series (e.g., x, y, z components or different quantities).
    - Handling axes, labels, and scaling.
    - Allowing basic interaction (e.g., hover to see values, potential zooming/panning).
4.  **Integrate Data Logging:** Modify target kinematics exercise components to record relevant data points (time, position vector, velocity vector) during user interaction or simulation playback.
5.  **Connect Exercise to Graph:** Pass the logged data stream or a mechanism to access it to the `KinematicsGraph.svelte` component within the exercise.
6.  **Styling:** Style the graph component to align with the project's visual design (Utopia, SCSS variables).
7.  **Iterate and Refine:** Integrate into one exercise first, gather feedback, and refine before rolling out to other relevant sections.

## Integration with Project Plan

This feature aligns with Phase 2/3 (Expanding the MVP / Future Ideas), specifically within the Kinematics chapter (Chapter 2 in the potential future outline). It is a significant feature that should be prioritized within kinematics development.

## Potential Challenges

- **Performance:** Efficiently logging and rendering potentially large amounts of data points in real-time.
- **Synchronization:** Ensuring the graph time axis accurately reflects the simulation time.
- **Accuracy:** Extracting precise data from the physics engine at appropriate intervals.
- **Library Choice:** Selecting a graphing library that is performant, easy to integrate with Svelte 5, and provides necessary interactivity.

## Success Criteria

- Students can see the graph update as the simulation runs.
- The graph accurately reflects the motion shown in the visualization.
- The feature is performant and does not significantly degrade exercise frame rates.
- Students report that the graphs help them understand the concepts better.
