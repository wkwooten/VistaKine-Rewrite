## Navigation.svelte Accordion Debugging (Ended YYYY-MM-DD)

**Goal:** Fix unexpected behavior where hovering over an _inactive_ chapter accordion in `Navigation.svelte` seemed to incorrectly apply active styles.

**Actions Taken:**

1.  Attempted refactor of `Navigation.svelte` to Svelte 5 Runes (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`, `$props`) to modernize and potentially resolve the hover issue.
2.  Encountered and fixed multiple Svelte 4 -> 5 linter errors (`export let`, `$:`, event directives `on:click`).
3.  **New Issue Emerged:** After refactoring, the chapter accordions stopped expanding visually when clicked, despite logs confirming the underlying `expandedChapter` state variable _was_ updating correctly.
4.  **Debugging Findings:**
    - Logs confirmed the `#if !navCollapsed && expandedChapter === chapter.slug` block evaluated correctly.
    - Console messages _inside_ the `#if` block executed.
    - Using `debugger;` inside the `#if` block paused execution as expected.
    - **Crucially:** When paused, the DOM inspector revealed that the HTML elements defined within the `#if` block (tested with both the original `<ul>` and a simple `<p>`) were _not_ being mounted/rendered in the DOM, even though Svelte was processing the block's logic.
    - Persistent, unexplained linter errors (`Expected token >`, `Unexpected block closing tag`) arose after attempting to simplify/modify the contents within the problematic `#if` block, even when the syntax appeared correct.

**Next Steps (New Chat):**

- Start with the reverted, working version of `Navigation.svelte`.
- Re-investigate the original hover/active state issue without immediately jumping to a full Svelte 5 refactor.
- If refactoring is desired later, proceed cautiously, testing the accordion functionality frequently. Consider if there's an interaction with SvelteKit routing or store updates causing the rendering glitch observed.
